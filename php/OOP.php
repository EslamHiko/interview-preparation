If you create a __construct() function, PHP will automatically call this function when you create an object from a class.
If you create a __destruct() function, PHP will automatically call this function at the end of the script.

public - the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is default
protected - the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class
private - the property or method can ONLY be accessed within the class

// Inheritance

<?php

class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;
  public function __construct($name, $color) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color;
  }
  public function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name} and the color is {$this->color}.";
  }
}

// Strawberry is inherited from Fruit
class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  public function message() {
    echo "Am I a fruit or a berry? ";
  }
}
$strawberry = new Strawberry("Strawberry", "red");
$strawberry->message();
$strawberry->intro();
?>
// Protected
<?
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;
  public function __construct($name, $color) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color;
  }
  protected function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name} and the color is {$this->color}.";
  }
}

class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  public function message() {
    echo "Am I a fruit or a berry? ";
    // Call protected method from within derived class - OK
    $this -> intro();
  }
}

$strawberry = new Strawberry("Strawberry", "red"); // OK. __construct() is public
$strawberry->intro(); // ERROR. intro() is protected
$strawberry->message(); // OK. message() is public and it calls intro() (which is protected) from within the derived class

?>
// overriding
<?
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;
  public function __construct($name, $color) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color;
  }
  public function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name} and the color is {$this->color}.";
  }
}

class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  public $weight;
  public function __construct($name, $color, $weight) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color;
    $this->weight = $weight;
  }
  public function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name}, the color is {$this->color}, and the weight is {$this->weight} gram.";
  }
}

$strawberry = new Strawberry("Strawberry", "red", 50);
$strawberry->intro();
?>
The final keyword can be used to prevent class inheritance or to prevent method overriding.
<?
class Fruit {
  final public function intro() {
    // some code
  }
}

class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  // will result in error
  public function intro() {
    // some code
  }
}
?>
// Constraints
<?
class Goodbye {
  const LEAVING_MESSAGE = "Thank you for visiting W3Schools.com!";
  public function byebye() {
    echo self::LEAVING_MESSAGE;
  }
}

$goodbye = new Goodbye();
$goodbye->byebye();
?>
Abstract classes and methods are when the parent class has a named method, but need its child class(es) to fill out the tasks.
<?
// Parent class
abstract class Car {
  public $name;
  public function __construct($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }
  abstract public function intro() : string;
}

// Child classes
class Audi extends Car {
  public function intro() : string {
    return "Choose German quality! I'm an $this->name!";
  }
}

class Volvo extends Car {
  public function intro() : string {
    return "Proud to be Swedish! I'm a $this->name!";
  }
}

class Citroen extends Car {
  public function intro() : string {
    return "French extravagance! I'm a $this->name!";
  }
}

// Create objects from the child classes
$audi = new audi("Audi");
echo $audi->intro();
echo "<br>";

$volvo = new volvo("Volvo");
echo $volvo->intro();
echo "<br>";

$citroen = new citroen("Citroen");
echo $citroen->intro();
?>

PHP - Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes
Interface are similar to abstract classes. The difference between interfaces and abstract classes are:

Interfaces cannot have properties, while abstract classes can
All interface methods must be public while abstract class methods may also be private or protected
All methods in an interface are abstract, so they cannot be implemented in code and the abstract keyword is not necessary
Classes can implement an interface while inheriting from another class at the same time

Interfaces allow you to specify what methods a class should implement.

Interfaces make it easy to use a variety of different classes in the same way. When one or more classes use the same interface, it is referred to as "polymorphism".

<?php
// Interface definition
interface Animal {
  public function makeSound();
}

// Class definitions
class Cat implements Animal {
  public function makeSound() {
    echo " Meow ";
  }
}

class Dog implements Animal {
  public function makeSound() {
    echo " Bark ";
  }
}

class Mouse implements Animal {
  public function makeSound() {
    echo " Squeak ";
  }
}

// Create a list of animals
$cat = new Cat();
$dog = new Dog();
$mouse = new Mouse();
$animals = array($cat, $dog, $mouse);

// Tell the animals to make a sound
foreach($animals as $animal) {
  $animal->makeSound();
}
?>
PHP only supports single inheritance: a child class can inherit only from one single parent.

So, what if a class needs to inherit multiple behaviors? OOP traits solve this problem.

Traits are used to declare methods that can be used in multiple classes. Traits can have methods and abstract methods that can be used in multiple classes, and the methods can have any access modifier (public, private, or protected).

<?
trait message1 {
  public function msg1() {
    echo "OOP is fun! ";
  }
}

trait message2 {
  public function msg2() {
    echo "OOP reduces code duplication!";
  }
}

class Welcome {
  use message1;
}

class Welcome2 {
  use message1, message2;
}

$obj = new Welcome();
$obj->msg1();
echo "<br>";

$obj2 = new Welcome2();
$obj2->msg1();
$obj2->msg2();
?>
Static methods can be called directly - without creating an instance of a class.
<?php
class greeting {
  public static function welcome() {
    echo "Hello World!";
  }
}

// Call static method
greeting::welcome();
?>
<?php
class pi {
  public static $value = 3.14159;
}

// Get static property
echo pi::$value;
?>
